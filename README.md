# serviceUses

ServiceUses is an ethereum project consisting on a Solidity contract, plus a node.js
application that manages the contract.

This application is intended to offer a blockchain based utility that allows an admin
to create several services and tracks/limits uses of this services by different users.

Application and contract are on active development, so anything can change without notice :)
